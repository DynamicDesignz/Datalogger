# Datalogger
Engine dataloging on Suzuki/Kawasaki ecc. Motorcycles

In the files you will find a code for a working telemetry/gps datalogger for the sds kds diagnostic interface compatible to suzuki and kawasiki bikes.
The average Timegap between the recordings is about 135ms, but you can adjust it for your purposes. The recording starts stops everytime the bike engine runs.
You can use it for wahtever you want, maybee for your racetrack or videoediting?
